   `3)` Disqualification - given for major infractions.

2. Organizers in cases where irregularities related to playing a Party occurred, can order repeating it.

3. If one of the Participants fails to show up on the scheduled date of the Party, the following procedure should be used (whenever the procedure includes phrases in the second person, the Organizers mean the Participant playing in a given Party who is waiting for his late opponent):

   `1)` After 5 minutes from the scheduled time, inform the Organizers that you are starting this procedure, then message your opponent on private message with EXACTLY the following text, without quotes: “I have attempted to play a Party with you, and now I am waiting for you to show up. According to the rules, you have 15 minutes from now to show up and start playing the game, or otherwise you will be penalized with a game forfeit. I have informed the Organizers that this procedure has begun."

   `2)` <a id="point-7-3-2"></a>After 15 minutes from the scheduled time, if the opponent has not shown up yet, you have to inform the Organizers of this situation, then message your opponent with EXACTLY the following text, without quotes: “You have not shown up as requested. I have informed the Organizer of this situation. I am waiting another 15 minutes for your response, but according to regulations you will be devoid of subjective restarts in this Party.”

   `3)` If the opponent does show up after sending the message in [paragraph `2)`](#point-7-3-2) and before the 30 minutes after scheduled time, they won't be able to use subjective restarts in this Party.

I have informed the Organizer of this situation. I am not waiting for your respone any longer.”

   `5)` If the opponent does show up and is willing to start the Party immediately, you should allow for the necessary setup time. If the opponent is visibly stalling for time, you should report this to the Organizers. As a rule of thumb, you should allow for at least 5 extra minutes to let the opponent connect to the online lobby and join the room.

   `6)` If this was a Party scheduled by the Organizers, and you neglect to inform the Staff about the fact that your opponent is missing, a double game forfeit may be given at Organizers discretion.

   `7)` You may delay this procedure up to an hour if you wish to give more time to your opponent - but you are not required to do so.

   `8)` For the procedure listed above, you have to provide proof in the form of a screenshot that you have messaged your opponent and they have not responded on time. Additionally, you should provide the proof of the scheduled date and time for the Party. If this procedure was used for an ambiguously scheduled Party, the Organizers may decide to not penalize the missing player depending on the full context. The Organizers may also decide to reduce the severity of the penalty in case of force majeure.

4. Participtant can appeal against the Organizers decision up to the day of the end of the phase following the phase in which they received the penalty.
